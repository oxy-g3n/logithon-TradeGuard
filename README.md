# TradeGuard: Rapid Compliance Checker for Cross-Border Shipments

## üìã Project Overview
TradeGuard is a compliance verification system designed for small export businesses that send parcels internationally. The system quickly verifies the compliance of each parcel before it's handed off to the courier, checking for basic issues like missing required fields, restricted item types, or conflicting destination restrictions, and flags any potential problems in real time.
