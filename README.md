# TradeGuard: Rapid Compliance Checker for Cross-Border Shipments

## üìã Project Overview
TradeGuard is a compliance verification system designed for small export businesses that send parcels internationally. The system quickly verifies the compliance of each parcel before it's handed off to the courier, checking for basic issues like missing required fields, restricted item types, or conflicting destination restrictions, and flags any potential problems in real time.

## üìä Suggested Datasets

1. **Sample International Shipment Data**:
   - UN Comtrade Database (simplified subset): https://comtrade.un.org/
   - Open source trade datasets from government portals

2. **Commodity Codes**:
   - Harmonized System (HS) codes: https://www.trade.gov/harmonized-system-hs-codes
   - Create a subset of common export items with their codes

3. **Country Restrictions**:
   - OFAC Sanctions Lists: https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/
   - Export Administration Regulations (EAR) country lists

4. **Simulated Data Generation**:
   - Create a script to generate realistic shipment data with:
     - Random but realistic weights (0.1kg - 500kg)
     - Varied declared values ($1 - $10,000)
     - Mix of compliant and non-compliant shipments
     - Common export items (electronics, textiles, food products, etc.)
     - Various destination countries (mix of restricted and unrestricted)

## üñ•Ô∏è UI/UX Design Recommendations

1. **Dashboard Layout**:
   - Clean, minimal interface with clear visual hierarchy
   - Color-coded status indicators (green for compliant, red for flagged)
   - Filterable and sortable shipment list
   - Summary statistics at the top (total shipments, compliance rate, etc.)

2. **Shipment Entry Form**:
   - Step-by-step wizard for manual entry
   - Drag-and-drop zone for CSV uploads
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Autosave functionality

3. **Compliance Details View**:
   - Expandable panels for each rule violation
   - Visual indicators of severity
   - Clear, actionable remediation steps
   - Option to override with authorization (audit trail)

4. **Report Generation**:
   - Preview before export
   - Multiple format options
   - Customizable templates
   - Batch export capability
